    "patient=\"\"\"The patient has HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and is undergoing 3rd-line treatment or beyond. The current status of the patient's brain metastases (BMs) is active. Local intervention for these BMs is not indicated. The BMs are evaluated to be between 1 and 10 and the patient has favorable prognostic factors. Given these conditions, the next step in the treatment plan is to assess the nature of the BMs further. Depending on whether the BMs meet specific criteria, the treatment may involve either resection if the BMs are located in or near critical areas of the brain with significant neurological symptoms or rapidly growing lesions, or stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) if the BMs are in non-critical areas, minimal or stable, or if the patient has comorbidities or poor performance status. If local intervention were indicated, the treatment would involve Tucatinib-capecitabine-trastuzumab. If the BMs had been greater than 10 with unfavorable prognostic factors, the patient would have received whole brain radiotherapy (WBT). For patients with no, unknown, or stable BMs, treatment options include Tucatinib-capecitabine-trastuzumab, Trastuzumab deruxtecan, or T-DM1.\"\"\""
